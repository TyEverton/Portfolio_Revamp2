          I am a Web Developer with a background in sales. My 4 years of sales
          experience gives me a strong foundation of client interaction,
          understanding and delivery. Because of my sales and customer facing
          experience, I am able to ask the right questions and dig deeper, which
          allows me to get an accurate idea of what the client is wanting and
          needing. I am excited to break into the industry and make a positive
          impact! As a recent graduate of Devmountain's Web Development
          Bootcamp, I am ready and excited to break into the industry and make a
          positive impact!
